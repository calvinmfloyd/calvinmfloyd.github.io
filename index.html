<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hi, I'm Calvin Floyd! Most people call me Cal. I have a passion for problem solving and utilizing data to optimize decision making. Currently, I'm a Senior Data Scientist working for the <a href="https://www.nba.com/kings/">Sacramento Kings</a>. Before that, I received a masters degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from <a href="https://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> and a bachelors degree in mathematics from <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/">SUNY Geneseo</a>.
</p>
<p>
My main other hobbies include doing puzzles, playing video games, watching TV and movies and both playing and watching sports. I've played basketball my entire life and, growing up in upstate NY, I'm huge fans of Syracuse Orange basketball fan and the Buffalo Bills. Overall, I like to try out new things to see if they stick or not.

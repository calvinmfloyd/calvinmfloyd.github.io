<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hi, I'm Calvin Floyd! Most people call me Cal. I have a passion for problem solving and utilizing data to optimize decision making. Currently, I'm a Senior Data Scientist working for the <a href="https://www.nba.com/kings/">Sacramento Kings</a>. Before that, I received a masters degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from <a href="https://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)</a> and a bachelors degree in mathematics from <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/">SUNY Geneseo</a>.

<p>
My main hobbies include video games, puzzles, TV shows, movies and both playing and watching sports. I've played basketball my entire life and, growing up in upstate NY, I'm a huge fan of Syracuse Orange basketball and the Buffalo Bills. Overall, I like to try out new things to see if they stick or not.
